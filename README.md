A Short Bio!

My name is Hafeez Abdul. I am a Front-end Web Developer, Content Creator and Digital Marketer based in Abuja, Nigeria. I have a strong understanding of HTML and CSS and at an intermediate level at JavaScript.

I started designing websites using Wordpress and Blogger as far back as 2012. My WordPress skill is outstanding. I started learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript in 2020 and improved my skills tremendously in 2021. That gave me the encouragement to create this portfolio website to showcase my projects.
