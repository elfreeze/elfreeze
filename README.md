A Short Bio!

I was Born in the gracious city of "Suleja", the city that was righteously known as "AbuJa" before the name was borrowed by the Federal Capital Territory. My main ambition is to become an Electrical/Computer Engineer at a very young age.

I currently work as a teacher in two public schools; a primary and a secondary school in Niger State of Nigeria. I teach Primary school Mathematics and Basic Technology for Junior Secondary school.

I use most of my time after work to work on my internet projects which initially started as a hubby that has now grown into a side-hustle. I use the extra income to expand my knowledge in computers, in general, A.I. (Artificial Intelligence) and M.L. (Machine Learning) in particular.

I strongly love Basketball. He play the game and watch most of Lakers and Warriors games`. My favorite players are the Late Kobe Bryant (RIP Kobe) and Steph Curry. My other hobbies are reading and learning new things.
